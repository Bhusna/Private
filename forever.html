          Thank you for reading all of this, for smiling at the silly parts, maybe blushing at a few lines,
          and hopefully feeling a little extra loved. That was the whole point.

        <p class="end-text">
          I don’t know exactly what the future looks like but I know one thing:
          I want you in it. In the random days, in the big milestones, in the late-night talks,
          in the “are you free?” texts, in everything.
        </p>
        <p class="end-mini">
          So this isn’t goodbye. It’s just “see you in the next memory”, Kammo jii. ♡
